<p>This is a "flow" script created for the Android app "Automate".<p>
<p>Made to separate weekend game functions from daily phone functions on an Android smartphone, Game Mode can automatically transform your phone into a handheld game console and back again with the flip of a switch. ðŸŽ®ðŸ“²</p>
<p>Game mode opens your frontend of choice when a bluetooth controller is connected, locking the screen orientation to landscape and redirecting the home launcher whenever the home button is pressed. The app switcher is also mapped to the Select button.</p>
<p>Normal operation resumes when disconnecting the controller, keeping work and fun in balance on the same device. ðŸ˜Ž<p/>
<p>On first run, Game Mode will prompt for your bluetooth controller and frontend. You can choose to reset these later at any time.</p>
<p>I originally created this script because I hate gaming on a smartphone and texting on a game console, but I like having only one device in my pocket.</p>
<p>Go figure...</p>
